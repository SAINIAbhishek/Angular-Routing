        <p>The first thing we have to do is to register the routes, and to do this we add our routes in app.module.ts because they will be responsible of our whole app and we configure our angular app in this file.</p>

        <p>So we add the const variable in the app.module.ts which is of Routes type. {{"const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent }, { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full'}, { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent} ];"}}</p>

        <p>The routes array of routes describes how to navigate. Pass it to the RouterModule.forRoot method in the module imports to configure the router.</p>

        <p>After this their is only one thing that is missing that is, where do we want to display/render the component, and we do this just by adding the router-outlet directive in the html file.</p>

        <p>The empty path in the route represents the default path for the application, the place to go when the path in the URL is empty, as it typically is at the start. This default route redirects to the route for the /home URL and, therefore, will display the HomeComponent.</p>

        <p>A redirect route requires a pathMatch property to tell the router how to match a URL to the path of a route. The router throws an error if you don't. In the app, the router should select the route to the HomeComponent only when the entire URL matches '', so set the pathMatch value to 'full'.</p>

        <p>The other possible pathMatch value is 'prefix' which tells the router to match the redirect route when the remaining URL begins with the redirect route's prefix path.</p>

        <p>The ** path is a wildcard. The router will select this route if the requested URL doesn't match any paths for routes defined earlier in the configuration. This is useful for displaying a "404 - Not Found" page or redirecting to another route.</p>

        <p>The order of the routes in the configuration matters and this is by design. The router uses a first-match wins strategy when matching routes, so more specific routes should be placed above less specific routes. In the configuration, routes with a static path are listed first, followed by an empty path route, that matches the default route. The wildcard route comes last because it matches every URL and should be selected only if no other routes are matched first.</p>
